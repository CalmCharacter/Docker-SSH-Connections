Docker Commands for this project:

Goal: 1. setup ssh connections between two ubuntu containers in docker
      2. configured ssh connections server and client in two ubuntu containers
      3. Connection two containers using SSH Command

Adding computer in docker group:
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker

checking your exisiting docker images:
docker images

Pulling image from Docker Hub:
docker pull ubuntu

Go to your directory where you want to put the container:
cd "Docker Practice Projects"
cd "SSH Connections 1"

Check if you are in the directory you wish to were:
pwd

Running Docker Container with Image:
docker run -it --name container1 ubuntu

Prepare for package installation:
apt-get update

install ssh server package:
apt-get install openssh-server

install nano (a simple text edit notebook use to edit ssh config files) package:
apt-get install nano

edit ssh config files using nano notebook:
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
then uncomment and change - PermitRootLogin yes
then ctrl+s to save, and ctrl+x to exit config file

check the status of what services running:
service --status-all

then run ssh:
service ssh start

now exit

create a second container
docker run -it --name container2 ubuntu

prepapre for package installion:
apt-get update

install ssh client package:
apt-get instasll openssh-client

now container1 and container2 installed ssh server and client package, in order to create ssh connection, we need to get password from the ssh server in container1

exit to container2 and start the container 1:
docker start Container 1

then go to interaction mode in container 1 by typing this terminal:
docker exec -it Container1 bash

once inside the container1, check the ssh server password:
cat /etc/shadow | grep root

then we can see the root password, but we will set our own new password and not rely on this for secure authentication:
passwd root
then type password: 123
and retyple password: 123

now we know the password of our ssh server, we need to get the IP address of our container1 server:

therefore we need to exit first in our container1,

but before we exit we need to check first the status if SSH is running:
service --status-all
service ssh start

then exit, 

then type this to terminal to check container1 ipadress:
docker inspect Container1 | grep IPAddress

as we can see our IPAddress for container 1 is - 172.17.0.2

after we know the IPAddress and password of our ssh server, we will go to the container 2 to connect to the ssh server:

we need to start the container 2 by typing in the terminal:
docker start Container2

then go to interaction mode in container 2 by typing this in the terminal:
docker exec -it Container2 bash

now type this to connect to the ssh server:
ssh roo@172.17.0.2
type yes,
and type password:123
